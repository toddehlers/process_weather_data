=============================================================================
IMPORTANT:
This program is written at University of Tübingen to manage EARTHSHAPE CHILE WEATHER STATIONS DATA.
What it does:
1- It can read the local and satellite data (*.csv)
2- It can append two local files (vertically that the newer goes below the older file)
    *Both files must be from the same station
    *There should not be any time over lap between the two files
3- It can use the local data to fill the gaps in the satellite files
    *Both local and satellite files should be from the same station
    *Always use appended local files to fill the satellite gaps
        **The format of appended files generated by this program has better compatibility to fill satellite gaps
4- It can plot all the recorded parameters in both local and satellite files for simple demonstration and for publication
5- It can generate monthly mean and standard deviation of the recorded pressure and temperature
6- Filtering data
    *Before running any process in this program you need to choose a filtering option
    1- You can filter the data which were recorded during the maintenance time (you need a maintenance file for this)
    2- You can filet the data if their values are not realistic (anomalies)
    We are using 6 filters:
    filter1: (sat/loc) -----> based on maintenance file
    Read the MAINTENANCE file and replace all the data recorded during the MAINTENANCE time by "nan"

    filter2: (sat/loc) -----> based on soil temperature
    If "GrTemp_Avg" and "VWC_Avg" both are recorded as zero all the following parameters are replaced by "nan"
    ["VWC_Avg","GrTemp_Avg","EC_Avg","P_Avg","PA_Avg","VR_Avg"]

    filter3: (loc) -----> based on wind diag
    If "WSDiag" is recorded as number which is not zero all the following parameters are replaced by "nan"
    ["WS_ms_Avg","WS_ms_max","WS_ms_min","WindDir_Avg","WS_ms_S_WVT","WindDir_D1_WVT","WSData2_WVc"]

    filter4: (sat/loc) -----> based on wind average speed
    If "WS_ms_Avg" is larger than 10 [m/s] all the following parameters are replaced by "nan"
    ["WS_ms_Avg","WS_ms_max","WS_ms_min","WindDir_Avg","WS_ms_S_WVT","WindDir_D1_WVT","WSData2_WVc"]

    filter5: (sat/loc) -----> based on wind maximum speed
    If "WS_ms_max" is larger than 20 [m/s] all the following parameters are replaced by "nan"
    ["WS_ms_Avg","WS_ms_max","WS_ms_min","WindDir_Avg","WS_ms_S_WVT","WindDir_D1_WVT","WSData2_WVc"]

    filter6: (sat/loc) -----> based on wind direction
    If "WindDir_Avg" is larger than 360 all the following parameters are replaced by "nan"
    ["WS_ms_Avg","WS_ms_max","WS_ms_min","WindDir_Avg","WS_ms_S_WVT","WindDir_D1_WVT","WSData2_WVc"]

17***************defcheck_columns
During the appending process if the two selected files have columns which
are not similar (names, order of the names and number of columns) it finds them
and correct them. This process is based on comparing each file by a set of
reference columns name and order, then identifies the extra and missing one and
add them. Of course these new columns must be filled by "nan"
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

which of the two selected files is older and put it in top of the newer one,
It checks the number of columns and the time gaps at the boundary of the selected files
New columns after columns correction and new rows after time gaps (missing rows)
correction will be filled by "nan".

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
21***************deffill_run
Start to fill the gaps in the satellite file based on the local data
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
22***************defsat_fill
This function finds the row(s) in the satellite file which at least have one
missing data ("None"). It extract the time of that row, find the similar time in
the relevant local file and replace that missing row with its local data
The replacing process is a bit tricky since the satellite data was recorded every
1 hour and the local data every 30 minutes, therefore to fill the missing satellite
row an appropriate calculation for each parameter must be used. for example:
to fill air temperature at 14:00 in satellite file, the average of 14:00 and 13:30 at
local file must be calculated. for different parameter it's different
(could be also sum or max or min). At the end it check the new file and ask for save
